# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution to Asset Viewer.

## Principles

Asset Viewer should stay small, local-first, and storage-agnostic. Features should improve visual review without turning the project into a second source-of-truth asset store.

## Development setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
python -m unittest discover -v
```

For UI work, use isolated local state:

```bash
export ASSET_VIEWER_HOME="$PWD/.dev-data"
export ASSET_VIEWER_CACHE="$PWD/.dev-cache"
asset-viewer demo --path "$PWD/.demo-assets"
asset-viewer serve
```

## Pull requests

Keep changes focused. Include tests for backend/CLI behavior where practical. For visual changes, include a screenshot or short description of the interaction that changed.

Please do not commit private image sets, machine-specific paths, API tokens, or review-state files.
