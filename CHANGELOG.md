# Changelog

All notable changes to Asset Viewer will be documented here.

## 0.8.0 — 2026-09-13

Context-and-handoff release.

- Replace permanent action-button clutter with state selectors and context-aware Actions menus across gallery, selection, asset review, family, annotation, and compare workflows while preserving keyboard review.
- Add optional per-asset provenance/generation metadata (`source_project`, tool, agent, model, prompt, seed, run ID, Git commit, parent asset, and bounded arbitrary JSON extras) without changing source-file ownership.
- Add metadata-aware browser search plus provenance exposure in review manifests, HTTP API, CLI, and MCP v2.
- Add a human-readable Activity view backed by the existing durable event stream, with recent-event slicing for long histories.
- Add exact approved-set handoff manifests plus optional explicit copy export; source originals are never moved or rewritten and public handoff payloads do not expose absolute server paths.
- Add metadata-only collection grouping for nested navigation without reorganizing source directories.
- Add autosaved review notes with asset-identity capture so rapid navigation cannot save a note onto the wrong asset.
- Expand regression coverage for smart-control UI invariants, provenance, Activity, grouped collections, approved handoff, CLI/API/MCP parity, recent-event ordering, and autosave identity safety.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-09-13

Live-review-loop release.

- Add an optional watchdog-backed filesystem watcher that runs with `asset-viewer serve` by default, coalesces filesystem churn, and retains periodic full reconciliation as the correctness fallback.
- Add `asset-viewer watch` for a standalone watcher process and watcher capability reporting.
- Add human-readable review reports in printable HTML or Markdown, including decisions, comments, annotations, variant-family context, and optional embedded thumbnails.
- Add a visible **Report** control in the gallery plus an authenticated `/report` route and `asset-viewer report` CLI command.
- Add an optional MCP v2 adapter over the existing durable review protocol, exposing collections, reviews, pending/completion state, ordered events, annotations, families, stable URLs, and explicit refresh without creating a second source of truth.
- Keep MCP optional via `local-asset-viewer[mcp]`; the normal viewer remains lightweight.
- Add regression coverage for real filesystem events, report escaping/output, report HTTP/CLI flows, and actual MCP v2 server tool registration.
- Refresh pinned GitHub Actions on current `main` before the v0.7 feature branch, avoiding stale maintenance history.

## 0.6.2 — 2026-09-13

Selection workflow patch.

- Add a persistent **Select all** button to the gallery toolbar.
- Select all acts on the current filtered/search view, so review batches can be narrowed first and then selected in one click.
- Disable the control when the current view is empty or already fully selected; existing **Clear selection** remains the explicit reset.
- Make the enlarged review view show a persistent decision indicator and visibly latch the active **Approve**, **Maybe**, **Reject**, or **Clear** button.

## 0.6.1 — 2026-09-13

Public-release sign-off patch.

- Make setuptools package-data intent explicit so source and wheel builds are warning-free while continuing to ship the static web UI.
- Add a final public-release audit/sign-off covering package integrity, privacy, security controls, protocol validation, deployment boundaries, and residual risks.
- Normalize family-member `present` values to JSON booleans so generated review manifests conform exactly to the shipped schema.
- No source-file ownership or destructive-file semantics changed from v0.6.0.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-09-13

Variant-family release.

- Add durable variant/version families keyed by stable asset UUIDs, without moving, renaming, copying, or modifying source files.
- Add explicit preferred-member state plus computed latest-member state for each family.
- Preserve family membership across same-filesystem renames because membership follows stable asset identity rather than relative paths.
- Add family metadata to gallery rows, review manifests, the versioned JSON schema, `/api/families`, and ordered event feeds.
- Add CSRF-protected family create/add/remove/prefer/rename/delete mutations to both production WSGI and development HTTP paths.
- Add CLI commands for family creation, inspection, membership changes, preferred-member selection, rename, and metadata-only deletion.
- Add gallery controls to group selected variants, extend an existing family, mark a preferred member, leave a family, and compare family members directly.
- Add regression coverage for rename survival, exclusive membership, source-file non-destruction, agent events, CLI flow, and production WSGI APIs.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-09-13

Precision-review and production-runtime release.

- Add point and rectangle annotations using normalized image coordinates, stable asset IDs, resolve/reopen state, event-feed integration, CLI/API support, and machine-readable manifest output.
- Bind spatial annotations to SHA-256 fingerprints of the annotated bytes so same-size/same-timestamp replacements mark location feedback stale instead of silently applying it to different pixels.
- Add in-view annotation tools and pinned feedback overlays without modifying source assets.
- Add linked/independent zoom and pan across comparison panes, plus reset controls, while preserving side-by-side, overlay, and difference modes.
- Make Waitress the default production HTTP serving layer; retain the stdlib server only as an explicit development mode.
- Move raster metadata inspection and thumbnail/review-preview decoding into disposable child processes with timeout, address-space/file-size limits, atomic cache publication, and bounded concurrency.
- Add preview-cache size/age policy, deterministic eviction, `asset-viewer cache`, and cache diagnostics in `doctor`.
- Add annotation, WSGI, worker-timeout, cache-budget, fingerprint-integrity, API, and CLI regression coverage.
- Keep full-file integrity hashing outside SQLite write transactions to avoid blocking concurrent review-state writes on large originals.
- Allow deliberate multi-process WSGI deployments to share CSRF state through `ASSET_VIEWER_CSRF_TOKEN`.
- Expand the public API/schema contract and publish a third security audit plus a second competitive feature audit.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-09-13

Durable catalog and agent-event release.

- Add stable UUID asset identities that survive same-filesystem renames.
- Add a durable SQLite asset catalog with scan generations, present/missing tombstones, dimensions, file identity, and change metadata.
- Preserve review status, comments, and history across renames; invalidate stale approvals when file content changes.
- Bind non-empty review decisions to a streaming SHA-256 fingerprint of the reviewed bytes; forced reconciliation detects same-size/same-timestamp replacements and completion re-verifies fingerprints.
- Keep deleted assets in manifests as missing/tombstoned records so automation can account for reviewed work that disappeared.
- Add cached gallery reads with bounded explicit rescans instead of recursive filesystem discovery on every page refresh.
- Prevent truncated scans from incorrectly tombstoning unvisited files or allowing a collection to be marked review-complete.
- Add ordered review/system event feeds through `/api/events` and `asset-viewer events`, including asset add/rename/change/missing/restore lifecycle events.
- Add `asset-viewer wait-for-review` for automation that needs an explicit human-completion gate.
- Allow review/history requests to target stable `asset_id` values.
- Bound concurrent thumbnail/review-preview decoding and mark generated preview responses private-cache only.
- Use bounded 2048px review previews in the carousel instead of loading full-resolution originals by default.
- Add stable per-asset deep links and `asset-viewer asset-url`.
- Add side-by-side, opacity-overlay, and difference comparison modes; sort by file size/resolution and search review comments.
- Keep configured collections visible when their source path is temporarily unavailable; fail review completion closed and report the condition in `doctor`.
- Harden direct non-loopback serving so authentication is required unless an operator explicitly acknowledges an external access-control boundary.
- Expand migration, catalog-integrity, rename, deletion, replacement, symlink, event, preview, and automation regression coverage.
- Add a tag-driven release workflow that publishes wheel/sdist artifacts, a CycloneDX SBOM, and SHA-256 checksums.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-09-13

Agent-review workflow release.

- Add explicit collection review completion/reopen state.
- Add `asset-viewer pending` with automation-friendly exit codes (`2` pending, `0` complete).
- Add review event history and one-step undo for status/comment changes.
- Add `history`, `undo`, and `collection-url` CLI commands.
- Add read-only pending/history APIs plus CSRF-protected complete/reopen/undo endpoints.
- Add filename/path search and client-side sort controls.
- Surface review progress/completion directly in the gallery.
- Fix duplicate `New` filter and duplicate review-note DOM IDs from the v0.2 UI.
- Increase review timestamps to microsecond precision so new work reliably invalidates older completion state.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-13

Security hardening and closed-loop review foundation.

- Prevent non-image files inside registered folders from being served by guessed URLs.
- Validate HTTP `Host` headers to reduce localhost DNS-rebinding exposure.
- Reject cross-origin review mutations with strict `Origin`/`Host` validation.
- Require explicit trusted hosts for non-loopback/reverse-proxy deployments.
- Treat Pillow decompression-bomb warnings as preview failures.
- Store registry/review data with private filesystem permissions where supported.
- Add regression tests for traversal, non-image disclosure, and Host validation.
- Move review metadata to SQLite with automatic migration from legacy `reviews.json`.
- Add review notes, new/seen state, batch-review backend support, and machine-readable review manifests.
- Add CSRF tokens and optional HTTP Basic authentication for remote/private deployments.
- Serve SVG originals as downloads and use inert preview placeholders instead of rendering active SVG content.
- Add bounded collection scans, image size/pixel limits, structured logging, and `asset-viewer doctor`.
- Add stable collection URLs (`/c/<slug>`) and a `New` review filter.
- Pin GitHub Actions to immutable commit SHAs and add Dependabot configuration.
